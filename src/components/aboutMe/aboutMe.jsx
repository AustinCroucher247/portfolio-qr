                    I'm Austin Croucher, a unique fusion of Philosophy and History graduate from York University,
                    seasoned restaurant industry professional turned aspiring software engineer. Passionate about life's complexities,
                    I've mastered the art of conflict resolution and dispute management, honed the skills of general management in the
                    culinary world, and navigated the intellectual rigors of software engineering at BrainStation.

                    My journey is unique, but it's the testament to my adaptability and thirst for knowledge. Transitioning
                    from the restaurant industry to software engineering may seem unusual, but it was a challenge I faced head-on.
                    This highlights my aptitude to learn quickly and adapt, as demonstrated by my successful completion of the intensive
                    bootcamp at BrainStation where I was able to aquire a diverse set of skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, Node,
                    Express, PHP, SASS, Git, MySQL, and Agile methodology, with a proficient command of JIRA.

                    I believe my diverse background will be a valuable asset to any tech team. Throughout my time managing restaurants,
                    I've fostered a knack for team collaboration, empathy, and dynamic problem-solving - skills that I believe are as crucial
                    in software development as they are in the restaurant industry.

                    Furthermore, my philosophical training instilled in me a logical and analytical mindset, aligning naturally with
                    the procedural logic required in programming. I am confident that my unique combination of experience, skills, and intellectual curiosity equips me to make significant contributions to the tech world.

                    In essence, I am more than my resume. I am a story of curiosity, intellectual growth, adaptability, and a strong
                    determination. I'm excited to bring these qualities to your team, to learn from you, and to solve the complexities
                    of the tech industry together.
